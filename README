Just getting started with cappuccino and I figured I would setup a bunch of simple helpers..
Feel Free to extend and play..
Thanks to CodingMammoth for getting this started and giving me his calender component

To Load this make sure you have rails 2.3 install along with cappucino 0.7b
If you need to know how to setup 0.7b watch the cappucinocasts and make sure to remove .6 first.

Then load the server
>script/server

and view at http://localhost:3000
